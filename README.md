# Chroma Semantic Search

This project demonstrates a basic semantic search system using ChromaDB
and SentenceTransformer embeddings.

## Features
- Text embedding using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Vector storage with ChromaDB
- Cosine distance based similarity search
- Simple and beginner-friendly structure

## How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

## Notes
- Results are ranked using cosine distance
- Lower distance means higher semantic similarity
